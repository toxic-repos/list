### We are against discrediting open source software

## What is this?

Recently, cases of adding code of varying degrees of danger to popular Open Source projects have become more frequent.
This can pose a threat to people, and also undermines the credibility of the Open Source community and Open Source as such.

## Recommendations

- Assembly isolation in containers, including for intermediate assemblies on developers' machines.
- Forks all libraries (if possible) and containers to yourself.
- Mirroring package repositories.
- Inclusion in CI of at least search by keywords, UTF characters with the image of the Ukrainian flag and comparison of the list of files with the whitelist.
- Research on code analysis tools.
- Sending a report according to [instructions](HOW-TO-REPORT.md)
